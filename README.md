Decision tree example by python
This is Decision tree example by python.
sample: tree_addhealth.csv
Classifier method: DecisionTreeClassifier from sklearn 

After spending several hours and uninstall/install python software several times, 
Finally I could figure out how to display decision tree in Spyder (python 2.7) in window 10. 

The output of decision tree is shown in decision tree.pdf. 
The figure is very small not easy to see since the tree is so big. 
I tried to zoom it but limited. 
It is a problem of graphviz program in python. 
Sorry about that.
